  <h2>Spaghetti and Meatballs blah blah blah</h2>
    <p>First, you'll need to boil a pot of water. Any pot, any amount of water honestly. Infact just get the biggest pot of water available, <em>fuck it up with water</em> then crank the heat dial as far up as it'll go.</p>
    <p>Once boiling like Anaki's skin on Mustafar chuck in a bushel of dry spaghetti pasta. Stir between tiktoks or reddit posts as needed.</p>
    <p>When the spaghetti is as maleable as you please, scoop it out of the pot and toss into the nearest trash bag.</p>
    <p>Now you can enjoy your boiling hot spaghetti soup.</p>
